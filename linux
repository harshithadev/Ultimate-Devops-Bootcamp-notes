- we can have any application as a service.
- all we need to do is, go to etc/systemd/system
- create a file with the name servicename.service
- and then insdie the file type :
  [Service]
  ExecStart=/usr/bin/python3 /opt/code/my_app.py

- for it to automatically restart everytime it stops, add this
  [Install]
  WantedBy=multiuser.target

  and add
  [Service]
  Restart=always

- this automaticaly restarts the service even if it
